# React Calculator
Calulator app as first foray into React. Uses MathJs as the actual calculation engine.

###Known bugs
+ Multiple operators will burn the chips
+ After the use of the buttons, the Enter on the keyboard seems to stroke twice.
+ For long sums the display expands, but does not auto contract
+ For long sums the history shoots off to the side, needs some kind of wrap
